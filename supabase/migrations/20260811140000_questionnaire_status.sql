-- Deterministic Data Questionnaire status per project — replaces asking the agent.
--
-- THE COMPLAINT. Clicking the `data_questionnaire` stage tag in the onboarding console opened the
-- CHAT AGENT with "What is the data questionnaire status for <email>?". That is the wrong shape for a
-- question with an exact answer: the console already knows the project, and an LLM re-deriving it from
-- a sentence can only be slower and less certain. Worse, the agent's own answer came from
-- `projects.metadata_completeness`, which reads 86 for almost every project regardless of content.
--
-- THE THREE QUESTIONS THIS ANSWERS
--
-- 1. WHICH FORM RESPONSE BELONGS TO WHICH PROJECT?
--    Two signals, in order, both verified against all 21 live responses on 2026-08-11:
--    (a) The form's REQUIRED "Grants" question returns a real grant TITLE, formatted
--        "R34: <grants.title> (PI(s): …)". Stripping the mechanism prefix and the trailing PI list
--        and matching grants.title resolves 16 of 21 to exactly one grant.
--    (b) Otherwise the respondent's email → grant roster, when they are on exactly one grant
--        (covers Wilbrecht, whose title did not match). Total 17 of 21.
--    2 responses select TWO grants (a real multi-grant answer, needs a human) and 2 are NIH program
--    staff on no grant (partial submissions, correctly excluded).
--    The importer records the winner as `metadata.questionnaire_response_id`, so once a response is
--    attributed it stays attributed and cannot be double-imported.
--
-- 2. HOW MUCH IS FILLED?
--    Computed live from the ten canonical fields, NOT from the stored metadata_completeness column.
--    The field list mirrors bbqs-agent QUESTIONNAIRE_FIELDS exactly so the console and the agent can
--    never disagree; `species` is special-cased because it lives in projects.study_species rather
--    than the metadata blob. Emptiness means NULL, '', [] or {} — a key that exists with an empty
--    value is not an answer.
--
-- 3. RELIABLE STATUS FOR PIs
--    Per project: fields filled/total, percent, status, and WHO submitted it — with the submitter
--    checked against that grant's roster, so the answer distinguishes
--      submitted by a PI  ·  submitted by a project member  ·  submitter not on the roster
--    instead of collapsing all three into one tick. Before this, `projects.metadata` held 84 content
--    keys and no record of who answered at all.
--
-- KG migrations are NOT applied by db push -- run this in the KG SQL editor (vpexxhfpvghlejljwpvt).
