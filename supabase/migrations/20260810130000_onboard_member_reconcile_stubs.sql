-- onboard_member must RECONCILE with NIH RePORTER import stubs, not duplicate the person.
--
-- GROUND TRUTH (2026-08-10, KG vpexxhfpvghlejljwpvt). Importing a grant from RePORTER creates
-- `investigators` rows that carry only a NAME — frequently with a doubled space, e.g.
-- "Firooz  Aflatouni" — plus the `grant_investigators` roster row with the correct PI role.
-- 24 such email-less records currently hold roster rows, so this is a CLASS, not a one-off.
--
-- `onboard_member` upserts BY EMAIL (`lower(email) = _email_n`). Those stubs have `email IS NULL`,
-- so onboarding one of them from the admin console does one of two wrong things:
--   * INSERTs a SECOND person, when the typed name differs from the stub by whitespace or case.
--     The roster row stays attached to the stub, so the new record shows `live_grant_count = 0`
--     and the pipeline reports "PI needs a grant" forever, while the stub sits on the grant.
--   * FAILS with 23505 on `investigators_name_key`, when the typed name matches the stub exactly.
-- Both paths were confirmed against grant 1U01MH144347-01 (SMART-DBS), whose five PIs are all
-- email-less stubs. Two name-collision pairs already exist in the table from earlier rounds of
-- this same bug: "Bijan  Pesaran" vs "Bijan Pesaran", "JACK  GRINBAND" vs "Jack Grinband".
--
-- FIX. Before inserting, look for an EMAIL-LESS record whose whitespace/case-normalized name
-- equals the typed name:
--   ADOPT — no email match exists: claim that stub (it already carries the roster rows) and set
--           its email, instead of inserting a twin alongside it.
--   MERGE — an email match AND a separate stub both exist: repoint the stub's referencing rows
--           onto the emailed record, DELETE the stub, and only THEN rename the keeper.
--
-- Two ordering constraints, both learned the hard way:
--   1. Every FK to `investigators.id` is ON DELETE CASCADE (`grant_investigators`,
--      `investigator_organizations`, `personality_scores` — the complete list per pg_constraint).
--      Repointing MUST precede the DELETE, or the grant roster row vanishes with the stub.
--   2. merge -> delete -> rename. Renaming the keeper before deleting the stub trips
--      `investigators_name_key` (23505) — the failure mode hit twice on 2026-08-07.
--
-- Adoption also DROPS an inherited `welcome_email: 'done'`. The 19 records the legacy backfill
-- marked complete have no email address at all, so no welcome can have reached them; keeping the
-- claim would hide a real outstanding step behind a false "done".
--
-- KG migrations are NOT applied by `db push` — run this in the KG SQL editor (vpexxhfpvghlejljwpvt).

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Same pass: stop checklist METADATA from being counted as an unfinishable step.
--
-- The view identified steps by excluding a blacklist of key NAMES ('status','offboarded_at',
-- 'pre_check'). Two metadata keys were never on that list, so they counted as steps whose value
-- is not 'done' — permanently inflating steps_total and holding required_incomplete >= 1, which
-- pins the row to "stuck" with no UI able to clear it (there is no action for a 'source' step):
--   source            — 23 rows, value 'legacy_backfill'
--   finished_by_admin — 3 rows, an ISO timestamp
-- Latent until now only because all 23 carry onboarding_completed_at and so sat outside the
-- pipeline. onboard_member ends with `onboarding_completed_at = NULL`, so onboarding any legacy
-- member — e.g. Firooz Aflatouni, a SMART-DBS PI whose record dates from the backfill — drops them
-- into the pipeline instantly stuck. Blacklisting the two names would fix today and break again on
-- the next metadata key.
--
-- Structural rule instead: an entry is a STEP only when its VALUE is one of the status vocabulary.
-- Metadata is self-identifying — a timestamp or 'legacy_backfill' is not a status — so future
-- metadata keys are excluded automatically, while a genuinely new step can never be hidden
-- (a real step always carries a status). 'pre_check' still needs its name excluded: its value IS
-- 'done', but it marks "a real run started" rather than work to do.
--
-- Built on the definition in 20260807180000 (reminder tracking), NOT the one in 20260806160000:

-- last_reminder_sent_at / reminder_count fails with 42P16 "cannot drop columns from view".
