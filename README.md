# BBQS — Brain Behavior Quantification and Synchronization

The **BBQS** program is an NIH-funded basic research initiative to develop new tools and approaches for a more comprehensive, mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of behavior. This repository powers the [BBQS consortium website](https://brain-bbqs.org), serving as the central hub for the community.

## About the Program

BBQS brings together a cross-disciplinary consortium of researchers to:

- **Measure behavior** — Develop tools for simultaneous, multimodal measurement of behavior within complex, dynamic physical and social environments, synchronized with neural recordings.
- **Model brain-behavior relationships** — Create novel computational models that capture dynamic behavior-environment relationships across multiple timescales, integrated with correlated neural activity.
- **Share data and tools** — Establish shared data archives (EMBER), ontologies, standards, and ethical frameworks that transform how mechanistic brain-behavioral research is conducted.
